## About

This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive guide to working with PySpark. The tutorials start with basic DataFrame operations and gradually move to more advanced topics, such as handling missing data, filtering operations, grouping and aggregating data, and implementing machine learning models using Spark MLlib. Sample CSV files (e.g., `tips.csv`, `name_data.csv`, and `name_data2.csv`) are included to provide real-world examples that you can run and modify.

## Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: Introduction and Installation
- **File:** `Tutorial_1_Introudction_and_Installation.py`
- **Content:** Covers installation of PySpark, using both Pandas and PySpark to load data, and performing initial DataFrame operations such as reading a CSV, displaying data, and checking the schema.

### Tutorial 2: DataFrames
- **File:** `Tutorial_2_DataFrames.py`
- **Content:** Introduces PySpark DataFrames, showcasing how to read data, inspect DataFrame schema, select columns, add and drop columns, and perform basic operations similar to Pandas.

### Tutorial 3: Handling Missing Values
- **File:** `Tutorial_3_Handling_Missing_Values.py`
- **Content:** Demonstrates different methods for handling missing data, including dropping rows or columns with nulls, applying thresholds, filling missing values, and using the `Imputer` from Spark ML to handle numerical data.

### Tutorial 4: Filter Operations
- **File:** `Tutorial_4_Filter_Operations.py`
- **Content:** Provides examples of filtering data within DataFrames using conditions. It includes single and multiple condition filtering, as well as using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT.

### Tutorial 5: GroupBy and Aggregate Functions
- **File:** `Tutorial_5_GroupBy_and_Aggregate_Functions.py`
- **Content:** Explains how to perform grouping operations and aggregate functions. Examples include grouping by names or departments, calculating sums, means, counts, and finding maximum values.

### Tutorial 6: PySpark ML (Machine Learning)
- **File:** `Tutorial_6_Pyspark_Mlib.py`
- **Content:** Introduces the basics of machine learning in PySpark. It covers using a `VectorAssembler` for feature engineering, splitting data into training and testing sets, training a linear regression model, and evaluating model performance.

## Datasets

The following CSV files are included for demonstration purposes:

- **`tips.csv`**: A sample dataset (e.g., for analysis on tips data).
- **`name_data.csv`**: Contains sample data used across various tutorials (e.g., personal details and salary data).
- **`name_data2.csv`**: Another sample dataset used for aggregation and grouping examples.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**  
- **PySpark**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional, if you want to run notebooks instead of the Python scripts)  
- **conda** (recommended for environment management)  
- **pip** for installing required packages

## Setup and Execution

### Cloning the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajbsarmi/pyspark_tutorial_Krish_Naik/tree/main
   cd pyspark_tutorial_Krish_Naik
   ```

### Setting Up the Environment

2. **Create the Conda Environment:**

   The repository includes an `environment.yml` file that lists all the required packages and their versions. To create the environment, run:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. **Activate the Environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate <env_name>
   ```
   Replace `<env_name>` with the environment name specified in the `environment.yml` file.

### Running the Tutorials

4. **Run a Tutorial:**
   For example, to run Tutorial 1:
   ```bash
   python Tutorial_1_Introudction_and_Installation.py
   ```

5. **Open Notebooks (Optional):**
   If you prefer to work with Jupyter Notebooks, launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
