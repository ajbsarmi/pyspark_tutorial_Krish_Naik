## About

This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive guide to working with PySpark. The tutorials start with basic DataFrame operations and gradually move to more advanced topics, such as handling missing data, filtering operations, grouping and aggregating data, and implementing machine learning models using Spark MLlib. Sample CSV files (e.g., `tips.csv`, `name_data.csv`, and `name_data2.csv`) are included to provide real-world examples that you can run and modify.

## Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: Introduction and Installation
- **File:** `Tutorial_1_Introudction_and_Installation.py`
- **Content:** Covers installation of PySpark, using both Pandas and PySpark to load data, and performing initial DataFrame operations such as reading a CSV, displaying data, and checking the schema.

### Tutorial 2: DataFrames
- **File:** `Tutorial_2_DataFrames.py`
- **Content:** Introduces PySpark DataFrames, showcasing how to read data, inspect DataFrame schema, select columns, add and drop columns, and basic operations similar to Pandas.

### Tutorial 3: Handling Missing Values
- **File:** `Tutorial_3_Handling_Missing_Values.py`
- **Content:** Demonstrates different methods for handling missing data, including dropping rows or columns with nulls, applying thresholds, filling missing values, and using the `Imputer` from Spark ML to handle numerical data.

### Tutorial 4: Filter Operations
- **File:** `Tutorial_4_Filter_Operations.py`
- **Content:** Provides examples of filtering data within DataFrames using conditions. It includes single and multiple condition filtering, as well as using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT.

### Tutorial 5: GroupBy and Aggregate Functions
- **File:** `Tutorial_5_GroupBy_and_Aggregate_Functions.py`
- **Content:** Explains how to perform grouping operations and aggregate functions. Examples include grouping by names or departments, calculating sums, means, counts, and finding maximum values.

### Tutorial 6: PySpark ML (Machine Learning)
- **File:** `Tutorial_6_Pyspark_Mlib.py`
- **Content:** Introduces the basics of machine learning in PySpark. It covers using a `VectorAssembler` for feature engineering, splitting data into training and testing sets, training a linear regression model, and evaluating model performance.

## Datasets

The following CSV files are included for demonstration purposes:

- **`tips.csv`**: A sample dataset (e.g., for analysis on tips data).
- **`name_data.csv`**: Contains sample data used across various tutorials (e.g., personal details and salary data).
- **`name_data2.csv`**: Another sample dataset used for aggregation and grouping examples.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**  
- **PySpark**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional, if you want to run notebooks instead of the Python scripts)  
- **pip** for installing required packages

## Setup and Execution

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
